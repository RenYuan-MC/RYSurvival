# If disabled, saving will occur at 5 minute intervals and on plugin shutdown.
# If you have a large server with many players and/or many shopkeepers, it

save-instantly: true

# Enables the automatic conversion of items inside the inventories of players
# and shop containers whenever a player opens a shopkeeper UI (eg. trading,
# editor, hiring, etc.) The items are converted to conform to Spigot's internal
# data format.
# This setting helps with issues related to items which have been created on
# previous Spigot versions or via some Minecraft mechanism (eg. give command,
# loot tables, etc.) no longer getting accepted when trading with shopkeepers.
# In order for the items to get reliably accepted during trades, their data has
# to match the internal format which Spigot uses when a plugin would create the
# same items via the Spigot API. Spigot occasionally makes changes to this
# internal data format. Any previously created items, or newly created items
# which don't conform to this new format, may cause trading and item stacking
# issues then.
# This setting is intended to help with the portion of the issue affecting
# shopkeeper trades. This setting will not reliably help you prevent item
# stacking related issues!
# Enabling this setting comes with a performance impact! Try to avoid using
# this option and search for alternative solutions instead (eg. stick to
# Spigot's data format when creating items via Minecraft mechanisms). Try to
# only keep this setting enabled for as long as required (eg. until you assume
# that most of your players' legacy items got converted by now).
convert-player-items: false
# If 'convert-player-items' is enabled, this setting toggles whether the
