# ChestSort Default Category File

# If you want to change this file, rename it.
# Please do NOT use file prefixed between 900 and 999 for
# your custom files because ChestSort will overwrite them

# When sticky is set to true, order the items in this
# category exactly as defined in this file.
# When set to false, the items are only grouped together
# and then sorted according to the other variables
# in your sorting-method
