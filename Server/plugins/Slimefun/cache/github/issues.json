ensure compatibility\r\n* [ ] ~~Add new ores to the tags so that the auto-smelter, vein miner and things work with them~~\r\n  (Gonna move this to after initial support as we really should modify the

Description\r\nImplements a new Talisman which puts items directly in your inventory after mining (if space available)\r\n\r\nIm making this draft early on so I can have some feedback to the following:\r\n- Do I add support for mob drops?\r\n- What would be the best way to edit the current functionality of ExplosiveTool (event) so I could integrate this Talisman with it (right now I get all the drops in the inventory but they also still drop on the ground and cancelling the event also cancels the blocks from breaking)\r\n- Do I add an entire new event for TableSaw implementation?\r\n- Should it give a message if it failed because the inventory was full?\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Add Talisman of Telekinetics (research, sfItem, sfItemSetup)\r\n- Edit Talisman of the Miner so it works with this new one\r\n- Add Talisman of Telekinetics main logic\r\n- Add Ancient Talisman Support\r\n- Move private functions to the bottom of the `TalismanListener` class\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n[Discord suggestion 1260](https://discord.com/channels/565557184348422174/627048923122499584/844259310773993513)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a

I was wondering if there is a way to unload the various slimefun blocks, instead of just saving them, as happens now.\r\n\r\nOr a help where you simply tell me mainly the classes that I should touch/look at in order to understand how to fix the problem... for now I have tried to fix the networks, I actually managed to do it, at least that's what I hoped for... but the problem persists...\r\n\r\n\r\n(I solved the problem of networks by unloading them when the world is unloaded (onWorldUnload event), using the method provided)\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\nto reproduce this problem you need 1 plugin that allows you to Unloose and load worlds (like SlimeWorld or MultiverseCore)\r\n\r\n1) at startup place slimefun blocks in a new world (not the main one!), create 1 network (cargo or Energy) and the furnaces that generate electricity (i.e. the head)\r\n\r\n2) Unload the world with /mv unload worldName or /swm unload worldName (make sure there is nobody in this world when you do these commands!)\r\n\r\n3) Wait a few minutes and reload the world with /mv load worldName or /swm load worldName.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\ndepends on what you place, I found errors in the console (in the case of the furnaces that generate electricity, due to lack of network) or simply the various blocks stop working properly (since are duplicated, or unusable due to the existence of a duplicate router)\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nYatopia\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.16.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nI use a recoding of the v4.9 \n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nAdvancedSlimeWorldManager","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","id":899857016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTk4NTcwMTY=","number":3076,"title":"Slimefun and PyroMining incompatibility ","user":{"login":"ItsSynchro","id":16171807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTcxODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16171807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsSynchro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."},{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2021-05-24T17:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T16:33:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nUpon using PyroMining and Slimefun, individuals are able to obtain PyroMining items if they break ores with a pickaxe that they don't have researched.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nAs per a discussion in the SF discord, this PR removes the use of explicit locks used in TickerTask. \r\nI'm not a massive fan of the implementation of `TickingBlocks` as it is right now. Currently its just been wrapped (mutex) so it isn't that much better for performance than it was before (might even be worse on that end). However, we now map the world to a long as opposed to `ChunkPosition --> Set<Location>` which means the memory footprint is considerably lower. \r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n- Add `TickingBlocks`, a class that serves as an accessor/wrapper for a `Map<World, Set<Long>>`. In other words, a `BlockPositionSet`. \r\n- Removes the public getters for the `tickingLocations`\r\n- Swap out the `Lock` + `Map<ChunkPosition, Set<Location>>` for `TickingBlocks`\r\n- Added relevant docs\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements. They only serve as guidance. -->\r\n- [ ] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [ ] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [ ] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [ ] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [ ] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3011","id":874195891,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NzQxOTU4OTE=","number":3011,"title":"Infused Hopper still works after being disabled.","user":{"login":"variananora","id":34732414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzMyNDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34732414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora","html_url":"https://github.com/variananora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2021-05-03T03:22:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-10T17:10:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ❗ Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\r\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\r\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\r\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\r\n\r\n### 📍 Description\r\n\r\nInfused Hopper still works after being disabled.\r\n\r\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain what you changed/added and why you did it in detail. -->\r\nThis pull request adds the `SoundService` and the `SoundEffect` enum which allow us to easily play sounds\r\nbut also allow server owners to easily configure and customize sounds.\r\nNote here that I opted for the minecraft-ids of sounds rather than the bukkit constants because this will allow\r\nserver owners to use completely custom sounds in combination with resource packs.\r\nIf a sound does not exist, the player will simply not hear anything, no error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen values are misconfigured, a helpful warning will appear in the console.\r\nThis will also protect us against Mojang sound changes in the future, as we don't have to worry about the support of changed enum constants or such.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new config file:\r\n```yaml\r\nPORTABLE_CRAFTER_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.wolf.howl\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 0.123456789\r\nSPLINT_CONSUME_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.skeleton.hurt\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\nTRASH_CAN_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: i.dont.exist.btw.spinach.sucks.and.pineapple.on.pizza.rules\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ToDo (Why this is still a draft)\r\n* [x] MockBukkit does not support String-sounds atm, so Unit Tests will fail, I will need to update MockBukkit for that first\r\n* [ ] I would like to add Unit Tests for this sound service too\r\n* [ ] Not all sounds have been converted yet\r\n\r\n##
