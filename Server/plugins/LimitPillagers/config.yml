   # Should we stop Pillagers from spawning anywhere? (overwrites Limiter)

Remover:

   # Should we also remove any Pillagers that are already in the world?
   # Checks for Pillagers on the chunk load event and can be used with the Stopper or Limiter!
   # I highly don't recommend using this. Only use if you need to.

Patrol-Remover:

   # Should we stop Patrols from spawning anywhere?

   Enabled: true
   
   # Should we ONLY remove the patrol mobs target to fix their lag but let patrols spawn and attack players like normal mobs? (Needs Enabled to be true)
