  enabled: true
  # This value determines how far away an entity has to be
  # from the player to start being effected by DEAR.
  start-distance: 8
  # This value defines how often in ticks, the furthest entity
  # will get their pathfinders and behaviors ticked. 20 = 1s
  max-tick-freq: 20
  # This value defines how much distance modifies an entity's
  # tick frequency. freq = (distanceToPlayer^2) / (2^value)
  # If you want further away entities to tick less often, use 7.
  # If you want further away entities to tick more often, try 9.

# Optimizes the suffocation check by selectively skipping
# the check in a way that still appears vanilla. This should

# Whether or not asynchronous mob spawning should be enabled.
# On servers with many entities, this can improve performance by up to 15%. You must have
# paper's per-player-mob-spawns setting set to true for this to work.
# One quick note - this does not actually spawn mobs async (that would be very unsafe).
# This just offloads some expensive calculations that are required for mob spawning.
